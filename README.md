# R

I utilized this Rmd file in order to study the relationship between the level of a parents involvement in their childs education, and thier 
child's corresponding grades in school from grades K-12. In order to study this correlation I looked at how race, parental education, household income, 
location, and internet access may affect a students grades and visualizations and logistic regression, I concluded these factors are all significant
predictors in a childs performance level in school.
